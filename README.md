# NHLtv_spoiler_blocker

This chrome extension helps preventing any spoilers for viewers that use NHLtv to watch replays of NHL games. 
Below is the list of its functions and the rationale behind them:

- **Hiding the timeline** (progress bar) during the game:
  - When the game is close near its end and the viewer moves their mouse or skips an ad block, they will instantly spoil the results by seeing how much (approximately, of course) time is left in the game - by deducing whether the game went into OT or not.
- **Hiding the clock**:
  - Same reason, as someone who watches most of the games, seeing whether the game took 2:30 or 3:20 will instantly tell me whether it went into OT or not most of the time (barring some special circumstances).
- **Hiding the match panel** on the right:
  - During the playoff, when trying to watch a series-clinching game, seeing there's another game planned in 2 days kinda gives up the result eh? 
- **Removing the "fade" effect** that comes up whenever viewer moves the mouse or uses a keyboard shortcut
  - This is just annoying, especially if there's no control bar visible.
- Option to keep **"Broadcast"** and **"Settings" buttons** visible
  - Sometimes it's useful to change broadcasts or change video quality during the game.
- Option to **enable/disable specific functions**
  - Allowing the viewers to customize their experience.
